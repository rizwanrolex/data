# Project Name: Employee Management System
# Description:
The **Employee Management System Design by Rizwan Rolex** is a simple console-based application written in C++ for managing employee data. The application utilizes file handling to store and retrieve employee information in a CSV file (database.csv). It provides the following key functionalities:

**Add Employee:**
Allows users to add new employees by entering their ID, name, and department.

**Display All Employees:**
Reads and displays all employee records from the database file.

**Search Employee by ID:**
Enables users to search for a specific employee using their unique ID.

**Exit:** 
Exits the application.

The project is an excellent starting point for beginners to understand the basics of C++ programming, file handling, and the use of streams (fstream and stringstream).
